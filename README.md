# Binary tree
A simple binary tree in C++

It's just a simple binary tree. 

# Supported functions:
1. You can push elements
2. You can get element by key
3. You can check by value if the element is in the tree
4. You can count elements with certain value

# To be made later:
1. Deletion of nodes
2. Self-adjusting (but I'm note sure if I'll ever do this)
3. Iterators
